# SEF (Servi√ßo de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras) visto consular

In the new SEF website (https://cplp.sef.pt/Registo.aspx) there are currently three options for requesting a
Visto Consular, but one of them isn't enabled yet. The enabled option is what I need. I don't like the idea of going to the website daily to see if that option is enabed. To avoid this tedious task, I decided to create a Python Script which goes to the website and look if the option that I am needing is enabled, if so, an email telling me that the option is enable is sent to me. This script is executed three time per day.
